        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Rutvik Chaudhari, a 3rd-year Computer Science Engineering student with a strong passion for software engineering. I have developed a solid foundation in programming languages such as C, C++, Java, and Python, as well as web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            <br>
            <br>
            I am particularly interested in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and enjoy solving complex problems through efficient coding. As I continue my academic journey, I am eager to apply my skills to real-world projects and contribute to the development of innovative software solutions.
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm always looking for opportunities to learn and grow, and I am excited about pursuing a career in software engineering.</p>

                <h3>Real Time Voice Translator</h3>
                <br>
                <p>The Real-Time Voice Translator is a software application that enables seamless communication across different languages. It converts spoken language into text, translates it into the target language, and then uses text-to-speech to communicate the translation in real-time. This project integrates speech recognition, machine translation, and text-to-speech synthesis to bridge language barriers, making it ideal for travel, business, and education.
